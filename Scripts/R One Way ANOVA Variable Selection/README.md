# R-One-Way-ANOVA-Variable-Selection

I set this up using instructions taken from https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/.   I used "Step 2: Clone the new GitHub repository to your computer via RStudio" to get the repository from github to my local computer.

# Repo contents

The repository contains the R One Way ANOVA Variable Selection code.  I added genMatFinalReducedSpace.R that shrinks the model space by assming an ordering of the factor level means (the actual ordering is not yet in place as of May 18, 2021).
